<H2>My Top 3 Movies of All-times</H2>

<hr>

<h3>The Amazing Spider-Man</h3>
<p>As a BIG fan of superheroes I consider this movie one of the best ones of the character</p>

<h3>Openhimer</h3>
<p>One of the greatest movies about history events, it also gives a good explenation of how humans will always look to
    be self destroyed</p>

<h3>Snow Society</h3>
<p>Really deep movie about a history and tragic event about an airplane accident that defines how the instinct of
    survival can show when is necessary </p>
